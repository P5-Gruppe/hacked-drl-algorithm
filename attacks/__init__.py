# NOTE: comments-only interface placeholder for observation attacks.
# This defines the contract for adversarial perturbations such as FGSM/STAR.

# Interface (to implement later):
# class ObservationAttack(Protocol):
#     def apply(self, obs: np.ndarray, step: int) -> np.ndarray:
#         """Return possibly-perturbed observation given the current step."""
#         ...

# Implementations plan:
# - class FGSMAttack(ObservationAttack): ...
# - class STARAttack(ObservationAttack): ...
